# About  
This website is made for my personal use to store certain bookmarks which I frequently access. It's so pain in the ass to find and open those tabs so I figured I'd rather make a website that holds all my important most used bookmarks.

# To Add New Bookmarks or edit
- Open `@/utils/websites.js`
- Add/Modify/Delete the website data along with required data such as top.gg vote, logo, text, image alt.
- Save and thats it!

## Future Development
I will make a small full-stack project in which you can
- Create your own account
- Upload upto 6 or 8 bookmarks along with a display photo
- Generate a personalized link which you can choose to be public ( if u want to share ) or keep it private ( so only u can access ).
- Then you can use that generated website to acccess your entered bookmarks whenever you want.
